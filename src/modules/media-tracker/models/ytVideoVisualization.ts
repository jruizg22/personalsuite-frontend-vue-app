/**
 * **YTVideoVisualization** – Domain model for YouTube video visualizations.
 *
 * Represents a single *visualization record* (or "view instance") of a YouTube video
 * within the application’s internal data model.
 *
 * This model is used in the frontend to track when a video was viewed,
 * optionally including the playback resume point (e.g., if the video was paused).
 *
 * ---
 * ### Key Points:
 * - Typically associated with a specific {@link YTVideo}.
 * - Used in both CRUD operations and derived data views (e.g., `YTVideoFull.visualizations`).
 *
 * ---
 * ### Example:
 * ```ts
 * const visualization: YTVideoVisualization = {
 *   id: 42,
 *   videoId: "yt12345",
 *   visualizationDate: "2025-11-07T14:30:00Z",
 *   resume: 120
 * };
 * ```
